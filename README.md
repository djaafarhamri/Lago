# Chess-Remake-

an online chess game coded withe mern stack (MongoDB, Express, React and node)and the help of socket.io, 
chess.js and chessboardjsx libraries it works pretty well but it is expected a lot of new features and changes
and its still far from production 

note: this is my first react big project and i've started it without any planning so the app concludes a lot of "bad practices" and needs needs a lot of work on optimistaion
